<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The diagram below illustrates the infrastructure and services created for this assignment. The system comprises a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) spanning three availability zones, each with private and public subnets.

Within the private subnets, application instance scaling is managed by an auto-scaling group. These application instances are registered with a load balancer’s target group and made publicly accessible via the load balancer.

Throughout this report, we will provide detailed descriptions of all infrastructure and services used.

### Built With Terraform
<p align="center">

</p> 

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) software tool created by HashiCorp. It allows developers to define and provision data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. This means you describe your desired state of infrastructure, and Terraform will figure out how to achieve that state.

With Terraform, you can manage a wide variety of service providers as well as custom in-house solutions. It has a pluggable architecture with providers to support a large number of infrastructure services such as AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, and many others.

Terraform keeps track of the current state of your infrastructure and applies incremental changes, making it efficient for versioning and collaboration. It also supports modules for creating reusable components, improving the maintainability and testability of your infrastructure code.

Terraform is widely used in DevOps practices for automating infrastructure setup and consistently replicating environments, making it a key tool in the realm of cloud automation and orchestration.
